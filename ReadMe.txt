Very basic WPF MVVM program.

I wrote this as a quick first shot at the MVVM pattern in WPF, with C#. 
At the time I was playing Planetside 2 and figured an Outfit manager was a relevant thing to code up.

It has a single Model, a single View and a single ViewModel.
It also uses Entity Framework Code First for accessing the SQL Server database.
